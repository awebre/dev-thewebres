    <p>
        Azure Container Apps require an SNI/SSL Certificate to be bound in order for custom domain names to work. 
        You can use Azure DNS Zones and <a href="https://github.com/sjkp/letsencrypt-azure" class="text-teal-500 hover:text-teal-600 hover:underline">this helpful open source project</a> to create automatically 
        renewing certs via Let's Encrypt, but Azure DNS Zones cost money (as do the Azure Functions and other 
        resources required for the automatically renewing cert). Instead, I opted to use Cloudflare's free Origin Certificates, which 
        can be set to expire every 15 years and you can configure notifications for expiring certs.
    </p>
    <br/>
    <p>
        On Azure, go to your container apps environment and select Certificates -> "Add Certificate". Then go to Cloudflare, 
        select the domain you would like to generate a certificate for and click SSL/TLS -> Origin Server. Click "Create Certificate", 
        and then click "Create" (the defaults should be sufficient). From there you will be brought to a screen with the Origin Certificate 
        and the Private Key encoded as text. Create a file on your desktop called your-domain.pem and past the full text of the private key 
        followed by the full text of the public key. DO NOT LEAVE THIS PAGE UNTIL YOU HAVE SUCCESSFULLY UPLOADED AND BOUND YOUR CERT.
    </p>
    <br/>
    <p>
        With this certificate saved to disk, go back to the Azure Portal and upload your certificate. Then go to the Azure Container App that you wish
        to bind the custom domain to and go to Custom Domains. Add a custom domain, enter the information required to validate your domain (some of which will be 
        DNS entries you need to enter in Cloudflare). Once you've validated your domain, you can bind the certificate by selecting the certificate you
        uploaded earlier to the ACA Environment.
    </p>

        In a matter of minutes, you should be serving your container app over your custom domain!
