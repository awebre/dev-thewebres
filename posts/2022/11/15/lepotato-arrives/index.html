Being a .NET Developer by trade, my first instinct was to find a way to host this instance in Azure. That seemed perfectly reasonable, considering the Mastodon source code comes ready for docker compose.</p><br><p>As I dove further into what it would take, it became increasingly likely that Azure wasn't going to be a cost effective option. Between trying to figure out exactly what I would need to run in a container (or if I would need multiple containers) and navigating Azure's complicated "Pay-as-you-go" pricing, I finally broke down and started looking for an easier route. Now, I could have gone directly to a Mastodon-as-a-service, I decided I would get setup with a VPS instead.</p><br><p>I'll be honest, I thought that setting up a Mastodon instance on a Virtual Private Server would be reasonably difficult. As it turns out, it can be really easy if you use a self-hosting software management system called Cloudron. All told, it took me about 10 minutes (and that includes entering credit card details) to get my Mastodon instance set up.</p><br><p>But let's face it, that wasn't difficult enough (and it's costing me $10/month). So I went on the internet, bought a knock-off Raspberry Pi (because I don't reward scalpers) and patiently awaited it's arrival.</p></section><section class="mt-8"><h3 class="text-lg font-bold">Le Potato Arrives</h3><p>So today is the day. Upon arriving home from work, I gathered up the heap of packages at my doorstep, burst through the door and started shedding the various products of their brown packaging. I quickly popped open the SD Card, popped it into my Macbook Pro and started frantically Googling for how to flash this SD Card with an Ubuntu image that is compatible with Le Potato and get it up and running.</p><br><aside class="text-sm italic text-gray-400">For more information on that process, check out <a class="text-teal-500 hover:text-teal-600 hover:underline" href="/posts/2022/11/15/lepotato-setup/">Setting Up Le Potato</a></aside><br><p>With my shiny new potato configured and ready to go, it was time to start working on setting up a Mastodon server, but there was one thing that was bothering me. My primary driver is a Macbook Pro, so I'm very used to doing this kind of work on the move. Given that Le Potato requires a hardwired internet connection and an external display, I was hopelessly tied to my desk. That seemed like a solvable problem, so I decided to jump down an entirely different rabbit hole: using a Cloudflare Tunnel to securely access Le Potato from anywhere in the world.</p><br><aside class="text-sm italic text-gray-400">More on that in the future...</aside><br><p>Unfortunately for me, navigating Cloudflare Tunnels, Cloudflare Zero Trust, and Cloudflare WARP, ended up being quite a bit more involved than I thought... But that's what this whole project is about - taking a deep dive into unfamiliar waters. For now, we'll just have to save conquering the Cloudflare universe for part 2 of Mésaventures de la Potate.</p></section></article><footer><div class="flex mt-16"><a class="mr-2" href="https://github.com/awebre"><svg class="h-12" role="img" viewBox="0 0 24 24" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><title>GitHub icon</title><path d="M12 .297c-6.63 0-12 5.373-12 12 0 5.303 3.438 9.8 8.205 11.385.6.113.82-.258.82-.577 0-.285-.01-1.04-.015-2.04-3.338.724-4.042-1.61-4.042-1.61C4.422 18.07 3.633 17.7 3.633 17.7c-1.087-.744.084-.729.084-.729 1.205.084 1.838 1.236 1.838 1.236 1.07 1.835 2.809 1.305 3.495.998.108-.776.417-1.305.76-1.605-2.665-.3-5.466-1.332-5.466-5.93 0-1.31.465-2.38 1.235-3.22-.135-.303-.54-1.523.105-3.176 0 0 1.005-.322 3.3 1.23.96-.267 1.98-.399 3-.405 1.02.006 2.04.138 3 .405 2.28-1.552 3.285-1.23 3.285-1.23.645 1.653.24 2.873.12 3.176.765.84 1.23 1.91 1.23 3.22 0 4.61-2.805 5.625-5.475 5.92.42.36.81 1.096.81 2.22 0 1.606-.015 2.896-.015 3.286 0 .315.21.69.825.57C20.565 22.092 24 17.592 24 12.297c0-6.627-5.373-12-12-12"/></svg> </a><a rel="me" href="https://social.thewebres.com/@austin"><svg class="h-12" viewBox="0 0 16 16"><path d="M 15.659 9.592 C 15.424 10.72 13.553 11.956 11.404 12.195 C 10.283 12.32 9.18 12.434 8.003 12.384 C 6.079 12.302 4.56 11.956 4.56 11.956 C 4.56 12.13 4.572 12.297 4.595 12.452 C 4.845 14.224 6.478 14.33 8.025 14.379 C 9.586 14.429 10.976 14.02 10.976 14.02 L 11.04 15.337 C 11.04 15.337 9.948 15.884 8.003 15.984 C 6.93 16.039 5.598 15.959 4.047 15.576 C 0.683 14.746 0.104 11.4 0.015 8.006 C -0.012 6.998 0.005 6.048 0.005 5.253 C 0.005 1.782 2.443 0.765 2.443 0.765 C 3.672 0.238 5.782 0.017 7.975 0 L 8.029 0 C 10.221 0.017 12.332 0.238 13.561 0.765 C 13.561 0.765 15.999 1.782 15.999 5.253 C 15.999 5.253 16.03 7.814 15.659 9.592 Z M 13.124 5.522 L 13.124 9.725 L 11.339 9.725 L 11.339 5.646 C 11.339 4.786 10.951 4.35 10.175 4.35 C 9.317 4.35 8.887 4.867 8.887 5.891 L 8.887 8.124 L 7.113 8.124 L 7.113 5.891 C 7.113 4.867 6.683 4.35 5.825 4.35 C 5.049 4.35 4.661 4.786 4.661 5.646 L 4.661 9.725 L 2.876 9.725 L 2.876 5.522 C 2.876 4.663 3.111 3.981 3.582 3.476 C 4.067 2.971 4.703 2.712 5.493 2.712 C 6.406 2.712 7.098 3.039 7.555 3.695 L 8 4.39 L 8.445 3.695 C 8.902 3.039 9.594 2.712 10.507 2.712 C 11.297 2.712 11.933 2.971 12.418 3.476 C 12.889 3.981 13.124 4.663 13.124 5.522 Z" style="stroke:none;stroke-miterlimit:10;fill-rule:evenodd;"/></svg></a></div></footer></div></body></html>
